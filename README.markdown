# What is this?

This is the source code to my [blog](http://michaelxavier.net). It is generated
using [hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), a static site generator written in
Haskell.

This code is intended to help anyone looking to build their own site using
hakyll. Note that most of the code is cobbled together using a *very*
rudimentary understanding of arrows and plenty of unabashed copying from other
hakyll-generated sites. To see how they did it, check out these 
[other examples](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/examples.html).
