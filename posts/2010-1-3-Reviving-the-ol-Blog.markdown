An explanation as to why I stopped writing on the old blog and my promise to write more frequently on this one.

## Why the sudden change of heart? 
I abandoned my old blog some time ago. I found it was harder to motivate myself to write by dumping everything into a tiny textarea. I found myself editing in my favorite editor (vim) because I didn't trust my browser and didn't really want to write in some AJAX monstrosity to save as I went. I work much faster in vim, I'm in it all day anyways, so what better place is there from which to do my blogging?

Furthermore, I found my interests shifting a bit. I do a lot more tinkering with rails at work. I think there's definitely something to be said for the degree of freedom you get from working with smaller frameworks like Sinatra. I like that you can decide on the structure and that the application is **exactly** as big as you need it to be, and no bigger. I've been using Sinatra every chance I get to prototype a future feature or app as its own mini-application. I will probably end up throwing away a good deal of background code this way, but plenty of it can be salvaged when it gets moved over to rails. 

I love the feel of starting a new project. Like dogs, ruby projects are so fun when they're young. I really like being able to play around with new libraries, write view code in haml/sass, and pretend like I'm a simple design purist, even when I usually can't afford to be.

Because of this, I have taken up the blogging platform [Marley](http://wiki.github.com/karmi/marley). I have made some modifications to it and will probably continue to do so. It's a robust platform, has a small footprint and is very flexible in how how can do your updates. 

## Why does the site look like this now?
Because I suck at design. I think it looks alright though. I like simple layouts, both from an aesthetic standpoing and from a standpoint of not wanting to spend all day trying to hack together something that looks better.

## How long until you abandon this blog as well?
I will probably be able to keep up regular posting until school gets really busy or in the rare event I get a life. Don't hold your breath on the latter, though.
