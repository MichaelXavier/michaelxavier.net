## Bucketeer
HTTP service for leaky bucket-style rate limiting, written in Haskell.

* [Github](http://github.com/MichaelXavier/Bucketeer)
* HackageDB to come as soon as I get some experience using it in the real world
  to ensure I haven't missed anything major.

## Bucketeer Client for Ruby
Ruby client for the Bucketeer rate limiting service.

* [Github](https://github.com/MichaelXavier/bucketeer-client-ruby)
* Rubygems: Same as above. As soon as Bucketeer is on HackageDB, this can go on
  rubygems.

## cron

* [Github](http://github.com/MichaelXavier/Bucketeer)

## HollaBack
Email reminder system inspired by [Followup.cc](http://www.followup.cc).
Written in Haskell backed by Redis. This component is the poller.

## HollaBack Admin
A Ruby support web server for HollaBack built on Padrino. This package
constitutes an administrative panel for HollaBack as well as a hook for the
[Postmark Inbound](http://postmarkapp.com/inbound) service.

## Web.MusicBrainz
I have ceased work on this project because of the unpredictability of the the
datatypes. I have since transferred ownership of the project over to
[this](https://github.com/ocharles/Web-MusicBrainz) repository.

## Web.RememberTheMilk
Haskell bindings for the RememberTheMilk API. Currently on haitus until RTM
fixes their JSON API to be less of an unredeemable nightmare to work with.

* [Github](http://github.com/MichaelXavier/RememberTheMilk)
