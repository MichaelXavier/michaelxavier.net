## Web.MusicBrainz
I have ceased work on this project because of the unpredictability of the the
datatypes. I have since transferred ownership of the project over to
[this](https://github.com/ocharles/Web-MusicBrainz) repository.

## Web.RememberTheMilk
Haskell bindings for the RememberTheMilk API. Currently on haitus until RTM
fixes their JSON API to be less of an unredeemable nightmare to work with.
