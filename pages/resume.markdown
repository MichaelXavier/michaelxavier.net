# Open Source Development

I have been participating in the open source community for over 4 years. Most
of my open source contributions recently have been in Haskell. I have several
packages in Haskell's HackageDB. Links to all of my projects can be found on my
website[^1] and at my github profile[^2]. In my time at CrystalCommerce, I
have extracted and open-sourced several RubyGems and contributed many patches
to Ruby projects.

I maintian a blog[^3] where I write about software engineering and techniques
in Ruby and Haskell.
